### Description

Version: Added Pause Function(P), fixed some bugs

Version: Fixed missing .BAS file

It's a game of asteroids, using classes, shapes, and trigonometry. I know it's been done before, but I got into the idea of doing it... Up cursor to thrust, Left & Right Cursor to turn, Space to fire. Escape to end. Runs well on PIII 500 Wint NT, I'd be interested to know how it runs under other O/S's. It's a lot easier to play at higher resolutions - 640 X 480 is too hard.
